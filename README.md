# WWWBasic

WWWBasic is an implementation of BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic
Instruction Code) designed to be easy to run on the Web.

## How to use WWWBasic

You can include WWWBasic directly in Web pages:

```

<script type="text/basic">
PRINT "Hello World!"
FOR i = 1 to 10
  PRINT "Counting "; i
NEXT i
</script>
```

You can also import WWWBasic as a Node.js module:

```
var basic = require('./wwwbasic.js');
basic.Basic(
`
PRINT "Hello World!"
FOR i = 1 to 10
  PRINT "Counting "; i
NEXT i
`);
```
